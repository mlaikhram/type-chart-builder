### Overview
Typecharts is a sandbox for gamers and designers to experiment with Type Charts and type combinations either for existing games or for the purpose of building a game that utilizes the Type Chart as a combat mechanic.

### Features
TypeCharts allows you to customize your Type Chart by editting the values directly in each cell and by using the various options listed below:
* <b>Edit:</b> Modify the title and types displayed in the Type Chart
* <b>Import:</b> Load an existing Type Chart from one of the presets available, or from a previously exported file
* <b>Export:</b> Save your Type Chart as an image or as a tych.json file, which can be re-imported for later use

You can also test out your creation by adding Type Combos using the <b>New Type Combo</b> button. Each Type Combo allows you to add a name and one or more types, which it will then use to calculate your combo's stats. This can help you determine which type combos are best for your strategy, or in a designer's case it could help determine if your type chart needs tweaking based on under/overtuned combinations.

### Build information
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
